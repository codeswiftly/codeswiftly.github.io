A tight 10-minute sequence to demonstrate SwiftUI craft without overbuilding.

## 10-Minute Flow

Minute | Move | Why it matters
------ | ---- | --------------
0-1 | Establish base view + data | Show clarity of layout and state.
1-3 | Add a glass card + bevel | Immediate depth and polish.
3-5 | Add shimmer to loading state | Communicate status and motion restraint.
5-7 | Add matched geometry transition | Prove navigation polish.
7-9 | Add symbol effect + haptic | Confirm native feel.
9-10 | Narrate tradeoffs | Performance and accessibility.

## Script Bullets

- "I start with a simple layout and local state."
- "I add depth cues for hierarchy without hiding text."
- "Animation is reserved for state changes, not decoration."
- "Matched geometry sells navigation polish with minimal code."
- "I call out Reduce Motion and maintain legibility."

## Exit Checklist

- One motion story, one depth cue, one feedback cue.
- Clear ownership of state and a crisp performance rationale.
