MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Interviewers Assess: Signal Areas. Better yet, have
someone you know read the story and do the same.
Do those map to what you hoped to convey?
• Review the Context and be sure it includes busi-
ness motivation for the project but is not too long.
Are all the details in the Context relevant to the
story in some way?
• Does the Table of Contents tell the interviewer
what they should conclude about you from each
section?
Examples of Core Stories
Let's review some complete core stories at different car-
eer points. Note that, as presented, these are pretty long
—longer than you would likely talk in an interview. I
would recommend you pause after the Table of Contents
and leave room in the conversation for follow-ups.
Example: An Early Career Designer
CONTEXT
I was working as a junior product designer at a fintech
startup, and our mobile app had a major usability problem
—users were abandoning the account setup flow at a 60%
rate. The existing flow had seven screens and required users
to upload multiple documents before they could even see
what the app did. The product team suspected the flow was
too long, but we didn't really understand where users were
getting stuck or why since collecting all the data and making
recommendations was part of the value prop for the app.
