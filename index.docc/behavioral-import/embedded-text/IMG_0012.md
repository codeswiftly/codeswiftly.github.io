MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
assumptions about user behavior. I worked with one of our
engineers to build a simple rule-based bot using our existing
knowledge base, which we deployed to a small segment of
users as a proof of concept.
The initial results were disappointing—only 12% of users
who interacted with the bot got their questions resolved,
and many users bypassed it entirely to submit tickets any-
way. I realized we had assumed users would ask direct ques-
tions, but they were actually describing complex scenarios
that our simple keyword matching couldn't handle.
I partnered with our MI engineer to rebuild the approach
using a more sophisticated NLP model that could under-
stand intent and context. This required me to coordinate
among engineering, customer support (who helped us cat-
egorize common question types), and our legal team (who
had concerns about Al providing incorrect information).

I also established a feedback loop where unresolved bot
conversations were automatically routed to human agents,
who could flag when the bot missed something important.
This data helped us continuously improve the model.
RESULTS
The final chatbot successfully resolved 45% of user in-
quiries without human intervention, reducing our support
ticket volume by about 30%. Customer satisfaction scores
for quick resolution improved, and our support team could
focus on more complex issues. The feature became a key sell-
ing point for new customers.
