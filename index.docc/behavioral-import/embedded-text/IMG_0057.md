MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
customization options in our dashboard. Every survey and
interview reinforced this, so I was able to win support for
building 15+ customization features including widget ar-
rangement, color themes, and data filtering options.
Post-launch analytics revealed that less than 10% of users
engaged with any customization features, and our overall
dashboard engagement actually decreased. Users were over-
whelmed by the options and many complained that the
interface felt "cluttered" compared to our simpler previous
version. We quickly spent some time removing most cus-
tomization options and redesigning around a cleaner, more
opinionated experience.
This taught me the critical difference between what users
say they want and what they actually use. People often ex-
press preferences for flexibility and control in research set-
tings, but their actual behavior shows they prefer curated,
streamlined experiences. I learned to validate stated pref-
erences with behavioral data and prototype testing before
committing to major feature investments. Now I'm much
more skeptical of feature requests that add complexity, even
when they come directly from user feedback, and I always
look for ways to test actual usage patterns rather than just
stated preferences.
