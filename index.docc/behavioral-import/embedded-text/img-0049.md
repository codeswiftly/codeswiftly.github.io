team with the senior eng providing daily consultation calls.
The approach worked better than expected. Maria's, the
mid-level engineer's, previous payments experience proved
valuable. Alex, the senior engineer, was able to step back

later acknowledged that my pushback had led to a better
outcome for the organization.

terms of organizational outcomes rather than team owner-
ship, and to always come prepared with data and alterna-

channels with peer managers about resource needs early
