MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
At RideLink, I led a team of 20 engineers to deliver a
mission-critical platform that enabled a 40% increase in
customer onboarding speed. I also introduced a biannual
hackathon that resulted in several ideas being turned into
production features. Across my career, I've worked on scal-
ing teams from five to 50 while maintaining a strong engin-
eering culture.
In my conversations so far with folks at Bloom, I've been
intrigued by the products and the connections you've built
between the teams and your customers. Sounds like an
interesting place for me to make an impact.
Example: Proactively Handling Complex Situations
If your career history includes layoffs, gaps, or short
stints, address these proactively and concisely in your
TMAY. Set the narrative yourself to avoid misinterpret-
ation.

V Gap: After Sparkly shut down, I took six months to up-
skill in cloud architecture and completed a certification pro-
gram. I'm excited to bring this expertise into a new role.
V Layoff: Due to the changing economics with their real
estate customers, HousingTech was under some financial
pressure, ultimately deciding to cut the entire Growth team.
V Short Stints: I've worked across a number of early stage
startups, which really accelerated my growth as an engineer
but ultimately none of them has panned out from a prod-
uct-market fit perspective.
