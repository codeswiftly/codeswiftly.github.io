V I recently graduated from State U with a degree in Com-
puter Science, and I'm passionate about solving challenging
problems with code. My focus has been on backend develop-

base queries, reducing query times. And during my final
year, I built a project management tool for remote teams as

I'm excited to bring my learning and enthusiasm to Bloom,
given its need for large, scalable systems.

At Acme Co, I led the implementation of a design system
that reduced UI development time by 30% and ensured
consistency across the product. Before that, I worked on a
