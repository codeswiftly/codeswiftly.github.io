MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
LEARNINGS
I learned that talking to real users early prevents building
the wrong thing. I also discovered that technical conflicts
are often best resolved through prototyping rather than de-
bate, and that I enjoy the challenge of making architectural
decisions under constraints.
Example: A Personal Story
Please review Junior candidates: when no work-related
stories are available before choosing to tell a personal
story. Namely, you should only do this if you are a junior
candidate and can't identify a work-related story.
CONTEXT
I'd been living in my apartment complex for about a year
and noticed that neighbors barely knew each other, even
though we all shared the same courtyard space. After a few
package thefts and some tension over parking, I thought
bringing people together might help build community and
address these issues naturally.
ACTION
I started by talking to a few neighbors to gauge interest
and quickly realized people wanted to connect but no one
wanted to take the lead on organizing something. I volun-
teered to coordinate a block party, even though I'd never
planned an event before.
I began by going door-to-door to understand what people
would actually want—some families with kids wanted ac-
tivities for children, while others were more interested in
just having a chance to chat.
