MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Of course you won't read the stories verbatim to the
interviewer, but you'll have thought about what to say,
about the transitions and key elements, and be much
more satisfied with your performance if you scaffold
stories in advance.
Build CARLs for Your Core Stories
Now is the time to write complete responses for your
core stories. Tackle this in any order you like, but I recom-
mend "inside out," focusing on Actions first:
1. Organize a Table of Contents. If you are senior or
above, your core stories will be long, so begin by
deciding how to structure your delivery.[151
2. Write the mini-CARL stories for each theme in
your contents.
3. Write the minimal Context for the overall project,
being sure to set the stakes high enough.
4. Finish with the Results and Learnings.
These steps are mostly straightforward, but let's cover
organizing a Table of Contents in more depth.
Organizing a Table of Contents
I typically see candidates choose one of two options to
structure their Actions into digestible themes:
1. Chronologically. Most projects have distinct
phases, and if you were deeply involved in the pro-
ject, you'll likely have key actions in each phase.
