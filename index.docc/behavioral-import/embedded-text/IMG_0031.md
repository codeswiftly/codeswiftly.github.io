MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
how tech companies work. This is a red flag, because
it doesn't fit with modern perceptions of workplace
dynamics in Silicon Valley-style companies.

Here are some best practices companies look for re-
lated to conflict resolution:
Be assertive: you disregard power structures when the
greater good is at stake. If you think you're right, you
speak up.
Go directly to the source: you do not triangulate
around conflicts or hide behind management (at least
not prematurely).
Remain emotionally in control: even in the face of
others' anger, you stay calm and professional, venturing
to care about the people involved even if there's disagree-
ment.
Stay focused on outcomes: you prioritize the organiza-
tion/product/user, and not personal gain. Of course, this
might only be how they present yourself to others; inside
you may have many motives.
Make data-driven, rational decisions: you believe in
the meritocracy of ideas and use fact-based persuasion to
advocate for your position. Data and logic are sufficient
to change your mind
