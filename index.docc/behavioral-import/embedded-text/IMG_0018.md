MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
STEP 4: THE BIG THREE
QUESTIONS
I've said you can't predict the behavioral questions you'll
encounter and that's true, but there are three questions
that appear in virtually every interview loop:
• Tell me about yourself
• Tell me about your favorite project/most impactful
project or otherwise a chance to tell one large core
story
• Tell me about a conflict you resolved
Since you know they're coming, you have an oppor-
tunity to prepare polished, practiced responses you can
deliver confidently even when you're nervous. Not only
are you very likely to encounter these questions, but they
give you a chance to cover a wide variety of signal areas,
establishing yourself as a good fit for the role.
Let's dive into how to craft compelling responses to
each of these essential questions.

nounced tee-may).
