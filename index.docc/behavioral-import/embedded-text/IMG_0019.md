MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
What to achieve in a TMAY
More than just a nicety, answering TMAY effectively can
set the tone for the entire session.
Break the ice and leave a great first impression.
Candidates and interviewers alike are nervous at the
beginning of an interview. Take this first few minutes to
make a lasting impression when the interviewer is most
attentive.
Set the context and your scope. Honestly, many inter-
viewers have not reviewed your resume—they might be
coming straight from another meeting and not even
have looked to see even which open role they're inter-
viewing to fill. Your TMAY anchors the conversation and
helps both of you.
Steer the rest of the conversation. A strong TMAY lets
you guide the interviewer toward topics that showcase
the best of your career. This ensures the rest of the inter-
view focuses on your repeatable behaviors, which is how
the interviewer will judge you.
Express passion for your role and for the company.
Paradoxically, the way to achieve all of this is to keep
your TMAY short-about two minutes. Interviewers
want enough context to orient themselves but are also
eager to dive into their more meaty questions.
