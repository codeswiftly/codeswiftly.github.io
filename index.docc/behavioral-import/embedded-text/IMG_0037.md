MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Choose the right communication channels: you move
from one communication channel to another based on
the state of the conflict. Comments on a PR or shared
document are rarely effective conflict resolution me-
diums. Sometimes casual conversations are best.
[30]
Demonstrate empathy: expressing an understanding
and an affinity for the other party's position greases next
steps and compromises.
Demonstrate maturity: even in the face of emotional
circumstances, you maintain your composure, and act in
a professional and laudable way.
Use data to make decisions: where data or proof-of-
concepts are possible, you collect or build them.
Involve the right coworkers at the right time: if other
people are needed, you pull them in when needed, not
before to create drama and not after when the project has
suffered a stall.
Don't take too long: invest time and energy relative to
the business value of the conflict, perhaps timeboxing
any data collection or deliberation steps.
Come to a clear resolution: even if the result is not
what you desired, there is clarity and a clear path for-
ward for all participants.
Preserve relationships: coworkers still want to work
with you after the conflict is resolved, even if they didn't
get their preferred outcome.
