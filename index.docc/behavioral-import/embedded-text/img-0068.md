MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
might not get there. If they ask about leadership
early, use your strongest leadership story.
The examiner
They rapidly fire questions, seeking quick responses.
They often interrupt to move to the next question. They
may work from a checklist or rubric, methodically tick-
ing through competencies. The pace feels brisk, maybe
even transactional.
This works for them since they need to assess lots of
signal areas in a tight window and they've learned that
letting candidates ramble wastes time. They'd rather
hear 30 seconds about ten different situations than ten
minutes about one project. Their goal is breadth of evi-
dence, not depth.
Here's how to be successful with these interviewers:
• Stay calm. Being interrupted doesn't mean you're
failing—it means they got what they needed from
that part of your answer. Don't get flustered or feel
like you did something wrong. This is just their
style.
• Front-load value immediately. With conversa-
tional interviewers, you can ease into a story. With
examiners, you can't afford that luxury. Lead with
the headline:
Tell me about a time you dealt with ambiguity.
