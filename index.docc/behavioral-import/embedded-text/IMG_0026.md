Counterexample: Don't Be Negative About Your
Former Employer
When describing the motivation for something new, be
positive about what you're headed toward, not negative
in describing what you're leaving behind.
X I'm looking for some place I can grow more technically.
My current company has really poor engineering, with the
codebase kind of a mess. My manager isn't interested in
addressing the technical debt at all. The product roadmap
changes every week, so we're constantly context-switching
and never actually shipping anything meaningful. Plus,
there's no real career growth path—l've been stuck at the
same level for two years.
This response makes the listener wonder if you are the
problem, and certainly exposes your lack of leadership
ability to drive technical and cultural change in your cur-
rent role.
You can be honest about your motivations without
criticizing your current employer:
V As I've grown technically, I've become increasingly inter-
ested in working on developer tools and infrastructure that
can impact how entire engineering teams work. That's what
draws me to this role—the opportunity to build in a culture
that knows how to ship and is known for technical excel-
lence.
