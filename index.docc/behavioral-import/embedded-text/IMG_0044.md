MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
showed that 60% of prospects were choosing competitors
specifically because of feature gaps around smart notifica-
tions and workflow templates. David became visibly agi-
tated when I suggested we needed to prioritize these com-
petitive features. He said I was being "short-sighted" and
that we'd "regret ignoring technical fundamentals."
ACTION
I realized this conflict was bigger than just Q3 planning---it
was about our entire product strategy and how we balanced
short-term competitive needs with long-term sustainability.
I needed to find a way forward that addressed both concerns
without completely sacrificing either.
First, I did some back of the envelope calculation on lost
revenue. Ideally I would have worked with the marketing
and customer success teams on this but I didn't have time.
I arrived at losing roughly $400K in ARR due to feature
gaps. I also asked David to detail the operational costs of our
technical debt--he showed me that engineering productiv-
ity had dropped 35% over six months, and our incident re-
sponse was costing us about 20 hours of engineering time
weekly.
I proposed a hybrid approach: dedicate 60% of engineering
capacity to the most critical competitive features (smart no-
tifications and basic workflow templates), while using 40%
for the highest-impact infrastructure improvements. David
pushed back hard, saying that "half-measures" wouldn't
solve the underlying architecture problems and would just
create more technical debt.
