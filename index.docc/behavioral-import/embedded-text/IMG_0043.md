MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
This experience taught me the importance of quantify-
ing technical risks in business terms that stakeholders can
understand. Rather than just saying "the data quality is
poor," showing the direct impact on revenue and customer
experience made the case much stronger. I also learned that
proposing solutions alongside problems is crucial. If I had
just pushed back without offering the compromise time-
line and conservative threshold approach, we might have
reached an impasse.
The product manager later told me she appreciated that I
understood the business pressure she was under while still
advocating for technical quality. We've since established
a regular data quality review process for all ML projects,
which has prevented similar conflicts and actually sped up
our overall development cycle.
