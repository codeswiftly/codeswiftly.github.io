MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
ies tend toward legal escalation or eventual separation,
certainly not collaboration or compromise. Third, and
perhaps most frustratingly, interviewers may distance
themselves from the situation, thinking, "That wouldn't
happen here," rather than focusing on your skills.
You shouldn't have to carry these experiences silently,
but in this narrow context with limited time, it's wiser
to select a story that's more easily mapped to experiences
the listener thinks you'll have in their organization.
Common elements of successful conflict resolu-
tion stories
As a way to help you remember Actions you took during
the conflict resolution process and to give you a sense of
what conflict resolution best practices look like in a tech
company, here are elements of successful conflict resolu-
tion stories I commonly hear:
Be proactive in raising concerns: if you are headed to-
ward a conflict, be the one who directly confronts it with
your coworkers. If you don't bring it up, then at least be
receptive when it's brought to your attention.
Only start constructive conflicts: no one likes a cantan-
kerous coworker. What you care about reflects on your
maturity and fitness for a role.

Seek to understand before being understood: often
more information is needed before jumping into a con-
flict. Perhaps you seek it from the main party or collect
corroborating evidence from others.
