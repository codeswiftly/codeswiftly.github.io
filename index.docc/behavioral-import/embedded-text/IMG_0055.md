MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...

Telling a story where you were wrong
[32]
I will reiterate that telling a story where you were wrong
is risky. Yes it shows humility and a growth mindset, but
you risk looking like someone who has poor judgment. A
company like Amazon even encodes being someone who
is "Right, A Lot" as part of their formal values.
I would only voluntarily choose a story when you were
wrong if you've already established yourself as compe-
tent and are seeking to demonstrate humility, flexibility,
and a growth mindset. This is more likely if you are inter-
viewing for a leadership role and you are an experienced
behavioral candidate; in other words, you know what
you're doing.
Sometimes you'll be asked explicitly about when you
were wrong. Preferably you have a story where you were
not obviously wrong in advance—or at least the inter-
viewer cannot find immediate fault with your position.
Note this may be difficult for you to assess since the
interviewer is likely more experienced than you.
