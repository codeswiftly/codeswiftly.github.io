Choose a project that has high impact, scope, and
personal contribution
When selecting your favorite project, optimize for three
key dimensions:
Impact: Choose work that moved meaningful business
metrics. This could be revenue growth, user engage-

benefited users or the business also work.
Scope: Look for projects with substantial breadth or

multiple signal areas. Complex projects spanning weeks
or months, involving cross-functional collaboration, or
requiring technical and non-technical problem-solving
provide richer material for showcasing your full range of
capabilities. Also ensure the project relates to your target
role in its primary focus.
