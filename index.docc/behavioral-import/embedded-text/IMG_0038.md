MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
If your story involves a number of these actions, it's
probably a good story to tell.
How CARL naturally turns into a three-act story
Using the CARL format is still a good way to respond to
a question about a conflict. When you tell the story this
way, it naturally forms a narrative in three acts, familiar
to any ancient Greek playwright or modern movie-goer:
• Act I: Setup (Context): setting the stage for the
narrative
• Act II: Confrontation (Action): the conflict itself,
followed by key turning points
• Act III: Resolution (Result & Learnings): the con-
clusion and end of the narrative.
This build-up of tension and subsequent release, end-
ing with narrative closure, presents a familiar emotional
arc, similar to how musical cadences progress and re-
solve. Moviemakers would dedicate 50% of their time to
Act II and an equal split of time for Act I and III, but I
would suggest more of a 10% allotment for Context, 60%
to Action, and 30% to Result and Learnings.
Here are some thoughts on how best to structure your
CARL story for conflict resolution:
• Move quickly through the Context section; get to
describing the conflict quickly. Don't go so quick
that you fail to land the high-stakes nature of the
conflict though. The listener needs to understand
what happens if the conflict is not resolved.
