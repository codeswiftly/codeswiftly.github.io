MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
When she still seemed hesitant, I brought in our head of
customer success, who confirmed that transaction blocking
issues were already our second-highest support ticket cat-
egory. This helped illustrate that launching with high false
positives would create immediate operational problems be-
yond just user experience issues.
After some back-and-forth, we agreed on a modified time-
line: I'd spend 10 days on data cleaning while working
closely with the customer service team to establish a labeling
process, and we'd launch with conservative settings that we
could tune more aggressively once we had cleaner training
data.
RESULT
The extra time investment paid off significantly. After
cleaning the data and retraining, our false positive rate
dropped to 8%, and we actually caught 15% more fraudu-
lent transactions than the original model. We launched one
week later than originally planned, but the product man-
ager was able to present much stronger metrics to both our
investors and the enterprise prospect.
The enterprise deal closed two weeks after launch, partly
because our fraud detection numbers were substantially
better than what they were seeing from competitors. More
importantly, we avoided what could have been a customer
service nightmare and potential churn from blocking legit-
imate transactions.
