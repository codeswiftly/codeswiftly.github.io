MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Good signs:
• You covered 5-7 different signal areas with appro-
priate depth
• The interviewer had time for their questions but
not excessive awkward silence
• The last 5 minutes felt purposeful, not rushed or
dragged out
Am I satisfied with story choice?
Evaluate your story choices. For each story:
• Did I choose the best story from my catalog?
Sometimes in the moment, you default to a famil-
iar story when a different one would have provided
stronger signal. Review your Story Catalog and
identify whether a better option existed.
• Did I emphasize the right aspects? Perhaps you
chose the right story but focused too much on
technical details when the interviewer wanted to
hear about stakeholder management, or vice versa.
• Did I answer the question asked? It's surpris-
ingly easy to pivot to a story you're comfortable
with rather than one that directly addresses the
question. If the interviewer asked about ambigu-
ous projects and you talked about large scope
but straightforward ones, then you missed the
opportunity.
