Did they ask follow-up questions?
Follow-ups or interruptions are to be expected and might
be positive or negative signs:
• Clarifying follow-ups (neutral to positive):
How big was your team? or What was the timeline?
suggest the interviewer is engaged and building a
mental model of your situation. They want more
details because they're interested.
• Probing follow-ups (positive): How did you make
that decision? or What alternatives did you consider?
indicate the interviewer is assessing your judg-
ment and decision-making framework. They're
going deeper because they see potential.
• Skeptical follow-ups (concerning): Wait, you did
all of that yourself? or How much of this was actually
your idea? suggests the interviewer doubts your
claims or suspects you're overstating your role.
• Redirecting follow-ups (negative): Let's move
on to another example? or frequent interruptions
indicate your response isn't providing the signal
they need.
