adapt accordingly:
The conversationalist
They ask fewer, broader questions and let you talk. They
listen carefully, ask thoughtful follow-ups, and try to
extract multiple signal areas from a single story. They
create a comfortable atmosphere and give you space to
share your thinking. The interview feels more like a dis-
cussion between colleagues than an interrogation.
This works for them because they believe the best sig-
nal comes from understanding how you think through
complex situations. They want to hear your reasoning,
your tradeoffs, your learnings. To them, one rich story
can reveal more than five surface-level ones.
Here's how to be successful with these interviewers:
• Manage your time ruthlessly. The biggest trap
with conversational interviewers is they'll let you
talk too much. They won't interrupt you, even
when you're telling the wrong story or belaboring
signal you've already covered
• Watch for cues that you've given them enough
on a particular signal area. If they've stopped
taking notes or asking follow-ups about a specific
aspect, you've probably established that signal.
Move on.
• Front-load your most important stories. Don't
save your best example for question five—you
