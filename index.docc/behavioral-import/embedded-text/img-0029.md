MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Personal Contribution: You need to have been a pri-
mary driver, not just a participant. The interviewer
wants to understand what you specifically did to achieve
the results. Being part of a high-impact team isn't
enough; you need clear ownership of significant actions
and decisions that influenced the outcome.
The sweet spot is finding a project where all three
intersect: substantial business results that you person-
ally drove through complex, multi-faceted work. If you
can't find a project that scores highly on all three dimen-
sions, prioritize personal contribution over the others—a
smaller project where you led everything is better than a
massive initiative where your role was peripheral.
Structuring your favorite project story
Since you're talking about a project of meaningful size,
you'll find it helpful to structure your response not sim-
ply as a single CARL but by organizing it into themes,
or groups of Actions, then signposting those themes
throughout your response.
See Telling Longer Stories.
Preparing and responding to follow-ups
As one of your core stories, be sure to prepare common
follow-up questions like, Were there any conflicts you en-
countered, What was the hardest part, etc. Refer back to
Identifying Follow-Up Questions. Also see the discussion
on how to respond to various kinds of follow-up ques-
tions in Adjust detail according to type of question.
