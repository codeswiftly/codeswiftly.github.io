MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
progress, but if your relationships are damaged, endan-
gering future progress, then your story casts doubt on
your conflict resolution skills.
When presenting the Result part of your CARL re-
sponse for a conflict, include the state of the relation-
ships after the conflict was resolved. Consider stating it
explicitly—Jenny was satisfied with this compromise and
expressed it in the follow-up meeting—and citing evidence
of future successful collaborations.
If relationships were damaged in some way, tread
carefully and provide some reason why the interviewer
should trust you to resolve conflicts. I see this most often
when the conflict is zero-sum or the candidate's response
was constrained by outside forces, leaving no room for
win-win outcomes, and the candidate did what they
could to bridge the personal trust gap but was ultimately
unsuccessful.
When your stories don't fit tech company culture
If you were in a hierarchical organization, perhaps a
traditional business, or even a tech company in parts
of the world where conflict is avoided and obedience to
management is expected, telling your story without add-
itional framing can reflect negatively on your ability to
resolve conflicts.
If this applies to you then consider these approaches:
Acknowledge the constraints of culture: describe
what was expected of you in that organization and why it
differed from a more conflict-embracing culture.
