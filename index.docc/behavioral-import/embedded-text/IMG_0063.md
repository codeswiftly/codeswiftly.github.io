MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
STEP 7: WHAT TO DO
AFTER AN INTERVIEW
If you made it through the interview, congratulations.
There are a few things to consider to maximize the value
you can gain from all your effort.
Capture details while they're fresh
Within 30 minutes of your interview ending, open a
document and brain-dump everything you remember:
• Every question you were asked
• Which stories you told and why you chose them
• Follow-up questions the interviewer asked
• Moments where you felt confident vs. uncertain
• Topics you wish you'd covered differently
• The interviewer's reactions and engagement level
• Any specific feedback they provided
Your memory of the interview degrades rapidly. Details
that feel crystal clear immediately after will become
fuzzy within hours. This raw capture is your foundation
for productive reflection.
Assess your performance
This is challenging, since most interviewers won't pro-
vide you any feedback or even reactions, but you can still
learn from what signal is available. Spend some time re-
flecting on these questions and jot down notes.
