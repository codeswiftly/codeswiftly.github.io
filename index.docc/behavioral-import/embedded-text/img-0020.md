MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
1. Personal Summary
2. Accomplishments
3. Forward-Looking Statement
Personal Summary
Start with a couple of sentences introducing yourself.
Think of it as a condensed LinkedIn About section. Men-
tion your role (e.g., backend engineer, full-stack devel-
oper), years of experience and title, and a unique trait or
focus that sets you apart.
I'm a Senior Engineer, focused on backend with five years
of experience building scalable systems and solving tough
performance challenges. I'm passionate about crafting so-
lutions that are not only efficient but also highly maintain-
able without documentation.
Tailor this summary to the job. If the role is for a
frontend engineer, don't introduce yourself as a backend
specialist.
Accomplishments
In the middle, highlight key achievements, similar to
how you would on a resume. Choose two to three accom-
plishments, ideally recent ones, that:
• Showcase core skills and business impact—re-
member, the manager is hiring you to accomplish
something in the real world (revenue, retention,
performance, etc.) so prove to them that you care
about outcomes.
