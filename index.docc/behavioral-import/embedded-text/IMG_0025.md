MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Counterexample: Overly Personal, Personal Summar-
ies
While the interviewer is interested in unique aspects of
you, make sure you share aspects relevant to the job. I've
heard a number of (especially junior) engineers begin
their TMAY with a story like:
X I've been interested in computing since I was 6, when I
worked on my first Scratch program in school...
Counterexample: The History Lesson
Avoid giving a chronological walkthrough of every job
you've had. It's tempting to say:
X I started as a frontend engineer at Company X, then
moved to Company Y, and now I'm at Company Z...
This approach is tedious and low-value. Focus instead on
the highlights and impact you want the listener to walk
away with. For example, if you want the interviewer to
hear about how you've worked at large and small com-
panies, say that; if you want them to hear about how
you've grown from a junior engineer to a senior engineer
quickly, then say that.
Counterexample: Less is Not More
X I'm a senior software engineer at Momentum, with 10
years' experience |full stop]
Some candidates omit accomplishments of any kind,
thinking they shouldn't repeat what's on their resume-
they probably got this advice from a well meaning but
inexperienced job coach. Bad idea. Many interviewers
haven't read your resume or at best they've skimmed it.
