in planning cycles, and I've become more proactive about
cross-training team members so we're less vulnerable to key-
person dependencies.
Be empathetic and positive
It's common for a conflict story to have unpleasant parts,
or more pointedly, unpleasant people. In those cases,
there is an uncharitable way to describe it, a framing that
might be accurate but ultimately negative.
Resist the temptation to tell the story this way, with a
villainous foil to your heroic righteousness. Instead, be
diplomatic, positive and generous in your framing and
express empathy toward those involved, even if at the
time you felt anything but empathetic.
X Our product manager was completely unrealistic about
timelines and kept demanding we add more features with-
out understanding the technical complexity. She would
interrupt our planning meetings, dismiss our concerns
about code quality, and basically treated the engineering
team like code monkeys who should just implement what-
ever she dreamed up. When I tried to explain why her time-
line was impossible, she got defensive and started micro-
managing our daily standups.

underlying tension but:
• Recognizes the PM's external pressures and posi-
tive intentions
• Frames her behavior as coming from passion ra-
ther than ignorance
