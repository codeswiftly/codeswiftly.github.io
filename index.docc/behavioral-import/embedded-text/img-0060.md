MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Tailor to you. Before the interview, identify what's most
important to you. This helps you ask questions that actu-
ally inform your decision:
• Skill growth
• Impact
• Work-life balance (but be specific)
• Culture and collaboration
• Career development
Be specific rather than generic. Instead of What is your
culture like? ask, Give me an example of how you've seen
[company value| play out on the team?
Experience-based rather than hypothetical. Instead
of How does the team handle conflicts? ask, Can you tell
me about a recent technical disagreement and how it was
resolved?
Include forward-looking statements. Not just asking
about past projects but also about what they expect to
happen in the future.
You only need one or two. You won't get a lot of time
for questions so choose judiciously.
Example Questions
Here's a set of topics you could ask about. I've collected a
lot more questions for you in Appendix: Questions to Ask
the Interviewer.
