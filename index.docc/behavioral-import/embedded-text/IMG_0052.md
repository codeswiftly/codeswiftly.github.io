MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
X Our lead designer had some thoughts about the user on-
boarding flow that differed from my product roadmap. She's
incredibly talented and really cares about user experience,
so I understood her perspective. We had a productive con-
versation about it and worked together to find a solution
that balanced user needs with business requirements. We
ended up iterating on the design and launched something
that made everyone happy.
The listener is simply confused by this. Where is the
conflict they asked about? Put the emotional content
back in to make the response relevant to the question:
V Our lead designer was upset when she learned I had
committed to shipping user onboarding in two weeks with-
out consulting her. She interrupted our standup to say that
my timeline was "completely unrealistic" and that I was
"setting the team up for failure." The engineering team
went silent, and I could see they were uncomfortable being
caught between us. I was frustrated too because the CEO had
been asking daily about onboarding metrics and I felt pres-
sure to deliver quickly. After the meeting, the designer sent
me a blunt Slack message saying she wouldn't sign off on
shipping "half-baked UX" that would hurt our conversion
rates. I realized this conflict was affecting team morale and
our ability to work effectively, so I scheduled a face-to-face
meeting where we could both express our concerns openly
and work out a realistic timeline that prioritized the most
critical user experience elements.
