Meta's behavioral interview (often called "Jedi") focuses on how you handle conflict, drive impact, and navigate ambiguity. To avoid downleveling, you must demonstrate **Senior/Staff** traits: identifying problems proactively, resolving conflict with data, and owning outcomes.

## Round Overview

The Jedi interview typically lasts 45 minutes and evaluates how you handle workplace challenges,
leadership, and cultural alignment.

### Core Focus Areas

- Move Fast: Acting with urgency and removing barriers.
- Focus on Impact: Prioritizing work that creates the most value.
- Be Bold: Willingness to take risks and make difficult decisions.
- Be Open: Encouraging transparency and giving/receiving honest feedback.
- Build Social Value: Creating products that bring people together.

### Common Prompts

- Conflict resolution: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker or had to work with a difficult team member."
- Handling failure: "Describe a situation where you had to take ownership of a failure or a mistake you made."
- Ambiguity: "How do you handle a project with changing priorities or extreme ambiguity?"
- Leadership: "Tell me about a time you led a team or took extra responsibility for a task you weren't expected to."
- Motivation: "Why Meta? What is your favorite Meta product, and how would you improve it?"

### Strategic Preparation Tips

- Use the STAR method: Structure answers as Situation, Task, Action, Result.
- Prepare for coding (SWE only): Jedi can include a short 15-minute coding problem in addition to behavioral questions.
- Leveling importance: For senior roles (E5+), Jedi is critical for leveling and can influence compensation more than technical rounds.
- Know your resume: Be ready to go deep on the numbers and results behind the projects you listed.

## Core Signals

Meta evaluates candidates on four primary dimensions:

### 1. Conflict Resolution

- **Signal:** Can you disagree and commit? Can you de-escalate tension and use data to resolve technical stalemates?
- **Avoid:** "We just talked it out and agreed."
- **Aim for:** Demonstrating a process—using prototypes, RFCs, or third-party mediation to find the best path for the product.

### 2. Managing Ambiguity & Perseverance

- **Signal:** How do you act when there is no roadmap? Can you deliver results despite significant technical or organizational blockers?
- **Avoid:** "I waited for requirements."
- **Aim for:** Showing how you created clarity—stakeholder interviews, rapid prototyping, or defining a V1 scope to unblock the team.

### 3. Driving Change & Influence

- **Signal:** Can you influence others without direct authority? Do you identify systemic issues and drive solutions that aren't on your immediate roadmap?
- **Avoid:** "I did my assigned tasks."
- **Aim for:** Describing how you spotted a gap (e.g., poor observability) and convinced leadership or peers to adopt a solution through demos and metrics.

### 4. Growth & Feedback

- **Signal:** Are you coachable? Can you internalize critical feedback and demonstrably change your behavior?
- **Avoid:** "I haven't really had negative feedback."
- **Aim for:** Sharing a specific moment of course-correction where you prioritized velocity over perfection or simplified an over-engineered system.

## The Meta STAR+ Structure

For every story, follow this expanded STAR format:

1. **Situation:** Context and the specific challenge.
2. **Task:** What was expected of you.
3. **Action:** Focus on **"I"**, not "we". Describe the specific engineering or leadership steps you took.
4. **Result:** Quantifiable impact (latency reduced by X%, team velocity increased, bug count dropped).
5. **Reflection (The +):** What you learned and how it changed your approach to future problems.
