Personal stories can be effective only when you truly lack professional examples (typically for
junior candidates). Even then, the story must demonstrate ownership, initiative, and measurable
impact.

## When to Use a Personal Story

- You are early in your career with limited work examples.
- The personal story shows leadership and sustained effort.
- The story includes a clear before and after result.

## How to Keep it Credible

- Emphasize the problem you noticed and why it mattered.
- Show initiative: you chose to lead without being asked.
- Highlight research or discovery you did before acting.
- Quantify outcomes and call out the learning.
