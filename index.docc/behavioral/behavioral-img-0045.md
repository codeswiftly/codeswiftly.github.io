# Conflict Example: Compromise and Relationship Repair


When a conflict becomes heated, the recovery is part of the story. This example highlights how you
used escalation and shared data to move from tension to alignment.

## What to Emphasize

- You brought in a neutral leader to mediate.
- You presented both sides with data.
- You accepted partial validation of the other side's concerns.

## Result Framing

Highlight both the business result and the restoration of trust. That shows maturity and long-term
leadership ability.
