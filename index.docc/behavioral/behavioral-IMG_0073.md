# Front-load Value, Then Back it with Examples


Some questions benefit from starting with the outcome and then adding proof. This approach makes
it easy for the interviewer to capture the signal quickly.

## Pattern

- Start with results and impact.
- Add learnings or insight.
- Provide context only as needed.
- Close with the key actions that made it happen.

## Use Case

This is effective for leadership stories where you want to demonstrate people outcomes and cultural
impact before diving into the mechanics.
