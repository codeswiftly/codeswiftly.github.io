Some questions benefit from starting with the outcome and then adding proof. This approach makes
it easy for the interviewer to capture the signal quickly.

## Pattern

- Start with results and impact.
- Add learnings or insight.
- Provide context only as needed.
- Close with the key actions that made it happen.

## Use Case

This is effective for leadership stories where you want to demonstrate people outcomes and cultural
impact before diving into the mechanics.
