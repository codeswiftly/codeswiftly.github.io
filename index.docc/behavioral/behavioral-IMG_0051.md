Do not erase the emotional content of conflict. If someone raised their voice, say so. The key is
to describe it factually and show how you stayed composed.

## Balanced Delivery

- Use a calm, objective tone.
- Describe the emotional intensity without exaggeration.
- Show how you responded with professionalism and clarity.

## Why This Matters

A story without conflict feels fake. A story with emotional realism shows you can handle pressure
without escalating it.
