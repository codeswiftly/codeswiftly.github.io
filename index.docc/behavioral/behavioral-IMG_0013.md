# High-scale System Migration Signals

Large migrations are a classic staff-level behavioral story. The goal is to show how you connect
technical architecture to business outcomes and risk management.

## Signal Areas to Emphasize

- Business impact and revenue risk tied to system limitations.
- Operational drag and reliability costs from the legacy architecture.
- Product constraints that blocked strategic features.

## What Makes This Story Compelling

- You quantify the cost of the current system.
- You align multiple stakeholders around a shared urgency.
- You frame the migration as enabling future growth, not just cleaning up.

## How to Tell it Well

- Start with the business pain and its measurable cost.
- Show the technical root causes in simple terms.
- Introduce the migration path as the least risky route to unlock the roadmap.
