# TMAY Examples by Career Stage (New Grad, Mid-level)

TMAY should sound different depending on experience. The structure stays the same, but the proof
points change.

## New Grad Focus

- Prioritize internships and any real-world experience.
- Turn projects into business impact by describing the user problem solved.
- Keep the tone confident but growth-oriented.

## Mid-level Focus

- Highlight ownership over a meaningful feature or system.
- Show measurable impact and a clear technical contribution.
- Position yourself as someone who can deliver reliably and improve a team.
