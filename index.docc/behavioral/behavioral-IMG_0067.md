Some interviewers prefer depth over breadth. They ask fewer questions and let you explore one
story at length.

## How to Succeed

- Manage time aggressively; they will not interrupt you.
- Watch cues that a signal area is satisfied, then move on.
- Lead with your strongest story early in the conversation.

## Why it Works

They believe the richest signals come from understanding your reasoning, tradeoffs, and learning
process over time.
