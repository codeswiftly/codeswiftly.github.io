# After the Interview: Capture and Reflect


The first 30 minutes after an interview are the highest-value window for learning. Capture details
before they fade.

## Immediate Capture Checklist

- Questions asked and stories you used.
- Follow-up questions and where you felt strong or weak.
- Interviewer engagement and any explicit feedback.

## Why it Matters

This raw capture becomes your feedback loop. Without it, you lose the data needed to improve your
next round.
