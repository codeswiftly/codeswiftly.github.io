# Post-interview Conflict Review

Conflict stories deserve a dedicated review because they are a decisive signal.

## Conflict Quality Checklist

- Was the conflict appropriate for your level?
- Did you show empathy and seek to understand first?
- Were you central to resolving it?
- Did you make a visible action that changed the outcome?
- Was the resolution win-win or at least forward-looking?
- What happened to the relationship afterward?
