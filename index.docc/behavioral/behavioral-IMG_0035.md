When you truly lack work conflict examples, school or personal stories can work. They still need
clear stakes, ownership, and a resolution that shows judgment.

## School Conflict Example Framing

- Emphasize a deadline or portfolio-level stakes.
- Show that you prioritized fundamentals over vanity changes.
- Explain the decision and how you protected the outcome.

## Personal Conflict Example Framing

- Anchor the disagreement in a shared commitment or budget.
- Show that you upheld the agreement and navigated the relationship respectfully.

## Avoid Misconduct Stories

Misconduct and harassment are not good interview conflict stories. The interviewer may focus on
legal or HR escalation rather than your conflict navigation. Choose a conflict that maps to normal
workplace dynamics.
