# User Feedback vs Usage Reality


Some of the best learnings come from when user feedback contradicts user behavior. This is a
high-signal story if you show how you adapted.

## The Pattern

- Users said they wanted more options.
- Post-launch behavior showed low adoption.
- You simplified and improved outcomes.

## The Lesson

Validate stated preferences with behavioral data and prototypes before making major investments.
