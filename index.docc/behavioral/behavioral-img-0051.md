# Keep Emotional Truth, Keep Professional Tone


Do not erase the emotional content of conflict. If someone raised their voice, say so. The key is
to describe it factually and show how you stayed composed.

## Balanced Delivery

- Use a calm, objective tone.
- Describe the emotional intensity without exaggeration.
- Show how you responded with professionalism and clarity.

## Why This Matters

A story without conflict feels fake. A story with emotional realism shows you can handle pressure
without escalating it.
