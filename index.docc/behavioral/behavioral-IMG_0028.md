# Choosing the Right Favorite Project


Your favorite project should be selected for signal quality, not personal sentiment. Optimize for
impact, scope, and personal contribution.

## Impact

Pick work that moved a real business metric, improved reliability, or unlocked growth. Concrete
numbers are best, but clear qualitative outcomes also work.

## Scope

Prefer multi-phase projects where you can show multiple signal areas: product, technical design,
execution, and rollout.

## Contribution

You need to have led critical decisions or actions. Ownership matters more than sheer size.

## The Sweet Spot

The best story sits at the intersection of all three. If you must trade off, prioritize personal
contribution over scope.
