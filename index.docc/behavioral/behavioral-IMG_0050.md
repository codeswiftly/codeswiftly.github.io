# Empathetic Framing in Conflict Stories

Conflict stories can include difficult people or tense moments. The goal is to show maturity and
empathy, not to cast yourself as the hero against a villain.

## How to Reframe the Conflict

- Acknowledge the other person's pressures and intent.
- Describe the breakdown as a shared communication gap.
- Focus on systemic issues rather than character flaws.

## Why This Matters

Interviewers listen for emotional maturity. Empathy signals that you can navigate tough situations
without damaging relationships.
