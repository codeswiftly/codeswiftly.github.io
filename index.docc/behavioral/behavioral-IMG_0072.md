# Adaptive Story Structure (RLCA) and Stake Framing

Once you know CARL, you can adapt structure to the signal the interviewer wants. One useful
variant is RLCA: Results, Learnings, Context, Actions.

## When RLCA Works

- Leadership and mentoring stories where outcomes matter most.
- Situations where you want to front-load impact quickly.

## Raise the Stakes Early

Ask yourself, "Why did this matter to users, the product, or the company?" Lead with that answer.
High stakes early makes the story feel important and worth the interviewer's time.
