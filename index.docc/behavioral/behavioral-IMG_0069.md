# Managing Detail with Fast Interviewers

When interviewers move quickly, your goal is to deliver value immediately and redirect when
needed.

## Tactics

- Lead with the headline and the outcome.
- Compress context to one or two sentences.
- Redirect briefly if you were interrupted before sharing a critical action or result.
- Use the Menu Technique: offer 2 to 3 angles and let them choose.

## Why This Matters

The right level of detail keeps you in control of the signal even when the pace is fast.
