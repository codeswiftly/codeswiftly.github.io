# Interpreting Follow-ups and Engagement

Follow-up questions are signals. They help you infer how your story was landing.

## Follow-up Types and Meaning

- Clarifying follow-ups: interest, neutral to positive.
- Probing follow-ups: they are assessing your judgment.
- Skeptical follow-ups: they doubt your role or claim.
- Redirecting follow-ups: your story is missing the signal.

## Engagement Cues

Watch for nonverbal cues and pacing. Even small shifts can indicate when to pivot or add detail.
