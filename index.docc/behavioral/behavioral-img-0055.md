# When You Were Wrong: Choose Carefully


Stories where you were wrong can show humility, but they are risky. Use them only after you have
already established strong judgment.

## When to Use Them

- Senior or leadership interviews with proven credibility.
- The mistake was understandable and defensible at the time.
- The learning led to a clear behavioral change.

## Avoid Obvious Errors

If the mistake was clearly wrong in hindsight, it can erode confidence. Prefer scenarios where the
tradeoffs were ambiguous and your initial position was reasonable.
