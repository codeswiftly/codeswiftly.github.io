# Conflict Resolution Signals


Interviewers want proof that you can handle disagreement with professionalism and outcomes in
mind. These are the behaviors they look for.

## Best-practice Signals

- Be assertive when the stakes demand it.
- Go directly to the source rather than triangulating.
- Stay emotionally controlled and respectful.
- Focus on outcomes, not personal wins.
- Use data and logic to persuade and to change your mind.

## When Your Story Deviates

If your story does not fit every ideal, be explicit about what you learned and how you would
handle it differently today.
