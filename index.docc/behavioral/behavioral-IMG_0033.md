# Common Conflict Story Patterns


Conflict stories do not need to be dramatic. Most are everyday disagreements about process, scope,
or technical direction. The key is how you handled them.

## Common Patterns

- Disagreement over implementation or process choices.
- Pushback on scope, time, or cost.
- Stakeholder demands that compromise quality or safety.

## What to Highlight

- The tradeoff you advocated for.
- The data or reasoning you used.
- The outcome and how the relationship evolved.
