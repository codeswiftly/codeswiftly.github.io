# Choosing the Right Conflict Story


Pick conflicts that show real stakes and your ability to drive a resolution. Low-stakes
preferences or minor disagreements do not communicate seniority.

## Selection Criteria

- High stakes: architecture, roadmap, or strategic direction.
- Deep involvement: you were central to the outcome.
- You were right or partially right: confidence with humility.

## Why This Matters

Conflict stories are about judgment. Choose a scenario where your reasoning held up and where the
resolution led to better outcomes.
