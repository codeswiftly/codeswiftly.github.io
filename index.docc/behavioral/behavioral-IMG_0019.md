TMAY is not a formality. It shapes the tone of the interview and positions you for the rest of the
loop.

## Goals of a Strong TMAY

- Break the ice and make a strong first impression.
- Set context and clarify your scope quickly.
- Steer the conversation toward your strongest material.
- Show genuine motivation for the role and company.

## Keep it Short

Aim for about two minutes. That is enough to orient the interviewer without consuming time needed
for deeper questions.

## Simple TMAY Structure

1) Present role and current focus.
2) Highlight 1 to 2 career highlights tied to the role.
3) Close with why this role and team are the right next step.
