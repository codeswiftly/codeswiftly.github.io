A strong "Tell me about yourself" answer follows a simple arc: who you are now, proof you can
perform, and where you want to go next.

## Personal Summary

Open with 1 to 2 sentences that describe your role, years of experience, and the focus that makes
you distinct. Tailor it to the role you are interviewing for.

## Accomplishments (2 to 3)

Pick two or three recent, high-impact achievements that align with the job and can be expanded
later.

- Include a clear business result.
- Add a light technical detail to establish credibility.
- Keep each one to a single sentence.

## Forward-looking Statement

Close with what you are excited to do next and why this role is a fit. This hands the conversation
back to the interviewer and keeps the tone positive.
