The favorite project question is usually the most important behavioral signal. It reveals how you
operate over time and whether you can deliver meaningful outcomes.

## What the Interviewer Is Actually Asking

- Can you deliver a complex project end-to-end?
- What scope have you operated at?
- How do you navigate ambiguity and tradeoffs?

## Treat the Question As a Core Story

Regardless of phrasing (favorite, most impactful, ambiguous problem), respond with your best core
story. This is your chance to set the tone for the rest of the interview.

## Signal Focus

Choose a project that showcases execution, ownership, and measurable impact. You can cover culture
and conflict later; this story is about delivery.
