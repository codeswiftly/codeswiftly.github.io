# Post-interview Story Audit


After each interview, evaluate whether you chose the right stories and emphasized the right
signals.

## Story Choice Review

- Did a stronger story exist in your catalog?
- Did you emphasize the right aspects for the question?
- Did you answer the question asked, not the story you prefer?

## Signal Coverage

Good interviews cover 5 to 7 signal areas without dead air. If you felt rushed or overly detailed,
adjust your pacing next time.
