Long stories require a deliberate action structure. The goal is to make your story easy to follow
and to control the signals the interviewer walks away with.

## Chronological Structure (Phase Based)

Chronological delivery mirrors how projects unfold and is the simplest to follow. It works best
when the project has distinct phases and your actions were meaningful in each phase.

Example phase outline:

- Discovery and research framing.
- Alignment and leadership buy-in.
- Design under constraints with a clear technical tradeoff.
- Implementation and technical problem solving.
- Rollout with coordinated stakeholders and risk control.

## Thematic Structure (Signal First)

Thematic delivery groups actions by the message you want to land, even when those actions occurred
at different times.

Two risks with a purely chronological story:

- Your most important signal may occur late, and you can get interrupted before landing it.
- You might need to reinforce a specific identity (e.g., "I de-risk launches"), which is easier to
  do by grouping related actions.

## Choosing the Structure

- Use chronological when clarity and progression matter most.
- Use thematic when you need to lead with the strongest signal and control the narrative.
