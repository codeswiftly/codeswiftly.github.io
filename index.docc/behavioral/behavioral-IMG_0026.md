# Positive Framing When Leaving a Role

Interviewers want to hear why you are moving toward something, not why you are running away. Keep
your narrative constructive and future-focused.

## Avoid Negative Framing

Complaining about your current company makes the interviewer question your judgment and maturity.

## Preferred Framing

- Describe the kind of work you want more of.
- Connect that to the opportunity at the new company.
- Keep your comments about the current role respectful and brief.

## Example Structure

- "I have grown technically and want to work on developer tools." + "This role is a direct match."
