Strong conflict stories show that you addressed the issue early and framed it as a constructive
problem to solve.

## Proactive Signals

- You raised concerns early instead of waiting for escalation.
- You stayed open when the conflict was raised by others.

## Constructive Signals

- You focused on the issue that mattered to the business.
- You avoided being combative or argumentative for its own sake.
- You gathered more information before taking a hard stance.
