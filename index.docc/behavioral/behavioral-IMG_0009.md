Before you practice a story, validate it with a few quality checks. These checks prevent weak
context, vague signals, or missing conclusions.

## Story Quality Checklist

- The Context explains the business motivation and stakes without drifting into noise.
- Each section in your table of contents includes the conclusion you want the interviewer to
  draw about you.
- A reader can map your story to the signals you want to convey (ownership, judgment, execution,
  influence, learning).

## Use the Table of Contents As a Pause Point

After delivering the table of contents, pause. This gives the interviewer space to ask follow-up
questions and lets you steer toward the most important part of the story.

## Early-career Example Guidance

Early-career stories should still have measurable stakes. Frame the situation in a way that shows
why the problem mattered, then emphasize how you clarified the root issue and drove a solution.
Even if your scope was small, your decision-making should be clear and accountable.
