# TMAY Accomplishments That Invite Follow-ups


In TMAY, accomplishments are not the full story. They are teasers that invite the interviewer to
ask for more.

## What Makes a Good Accomplishment

- Aligned with the role you want.
- Connected to business impact or user outcomes.
- Easy to expand into a full STAR or CARL story.

## Example Pattern

- Lead with the impact.
- Add just enough technical signal to show credibility.
- Stop before the full story to keep the interviewer curious.

## Forward-looking Close

Finish with the role and scope you want next. This turns TMAY into a bridge, not a dead end.
