# Structuring and Defending the Favorite Project Story


The favorite project is large enough that a single CARL often feels cramped. Organize actions into
clear themes and prepare for follow-up questions.

## Structure for Long Stories

- Group actions into themes and signpost them.
- Keep the table of contents short and memorable.
- Use transitions so the interviewer never loses the plot.

## Prepare for Follow-ups

Expect questions about conflict, hardest decisions, and tradeoffs. Prepare a few targeted answers
so you can go deeper without rambling.
