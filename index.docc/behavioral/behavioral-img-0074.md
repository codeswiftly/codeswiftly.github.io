# The Menu Technique for Ambiguous Questions


When a question could be answered multiple ways, offer a short menu of story options and let the
interviewer choose.

## When to Use it

- Your stories have very different takeaways.
- The interviewer asked for a different example.
- Time is short and you need to maximize signal.
- The question is ambiguous and you want clarity.

## How to Do it

Offer 2 to 3 options with a one-line takeaway each. Then follow the interviewer's choice.
