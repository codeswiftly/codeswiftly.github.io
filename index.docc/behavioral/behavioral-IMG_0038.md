Conflict stories are most effective when they follow a clear narrative arc.

## Three-act Structure

- Act I: Context (setup and stakes).
- Act II: Action (conflict, turning points, and your moves).
- Act III: Result and Learning (resolution and takeaways).

## Time Allocation Guide

- Context: about 10% (just enough to establish stakes).
- Action: about 60% (the conflict navigation is the core signal).
- Result + Learning: about 30% (show closure and growth).

## Delivery Tips

- Move quickly through context, but make the stakes real.
- Emphasize the actions that moved the conflict forward.
- Add more human detail than you would in a standard CARL.
