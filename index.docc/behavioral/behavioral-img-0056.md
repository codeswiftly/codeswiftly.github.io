## What Makes it Safe

- Your reasoning was sound given the data at the time.
- New information changed the outcome.
- You adjusted your decision-making process going forward.

## Learning Focus

Highlight how you now validate assumptions, weigh organizational reality, and choose evolutionary
approaches when the environment is not ready for heavy architecture.
