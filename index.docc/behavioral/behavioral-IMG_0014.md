# Stakeholder Alignment with Quantified Impact

A high-signal behavioral story shows you gathered evidence and used it to align senior
stakeholders who had competing priorities.

## Evidence-driven Alignment

- Validate impact with real data (sales losses, support load, engineering capacity).
- Translate technical pain into business metrics.
- Use that data to secure resourcing and buy-in.

## Multi-stakeholder Strategy

- Engineering leadership aligns quickly on technical risk.
- Product leadership needs proof of roadmap impact.
- Sales and customer success provide revenue and churn evidence.

## Rollout and Risk Mitigation

Pair the alignment story with a safe migration plan. Show that you balanced urgency with
stability, and that you planned the rollout to avoid downtime.
