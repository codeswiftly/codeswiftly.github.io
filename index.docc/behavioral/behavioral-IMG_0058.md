The final minutes of an interview are not a courtesy slot. Your questions are evaluated as a
signal of preparation, maturity, and fit.

## What Good Questions Prove

- You researched the role and company.
- You understand what success requires.
- You know what you need to thrive.
- You are genuinely interested in this team.

## Use This Time Strategically

Ask questions that help you assess role fit and reveal the team's priorities, culture, and
challenges.
