# The Big Three Behavioral Questions


You cannot predict every behavioral prompt, but three questions appear in almost every loop.
Prepare polished responses for these so you can deliver confidently under pressure.

## The Three Questions

- Tell me about yourself.
- Tell me about your favorite or most impactful project.
- Tell me about a conflict you resolved.

## Why They Matter

These questions let you cover the widest range of signals: ownership, execution, influence, and
learning. A strong response here sets the tone for the rest of the interview.

## How to Prepare

- Build a 2-minute version and a 4-minute version of each response.
- Practice transitions so your delivery feels composed, not memorized.
- Make sure each response maps to the role you want.
