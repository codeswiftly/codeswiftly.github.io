Listing a concise set of achievements can create a positive halo effect, making you appear
consistently high-performing across domains.

## Use it Carefully

- Start with your strongest 1 to 2 achievements.
- Keep the list short and high-signal.
- Avoid piling on excessive detail.

## Why This Works

A brief, diverse set of wins makes you feel broadly capable without overwhelming the listener.
