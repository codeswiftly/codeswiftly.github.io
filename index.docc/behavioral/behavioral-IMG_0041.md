A good conflict story ends with measurable results and a preserved working relationship.

## What to Highlight

- Improved metrics after the compromise (accuracy, false positives, or revenue impact).
- The deal or business outcome that closed because of the improved metrics.
- The working relationship improved because you acknowledged pressures on the other side.
