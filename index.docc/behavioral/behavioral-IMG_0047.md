Resource conflicts are leadership tests. This example highlights balancing enterprise compliance

## What to Surface

- The stakes and revenue impact on both sides.
- Your responsibility to protect your team's critical path.
- Your willingness to engage in a broader organizational solution.

## Why it Matters

Managers are evaluated on how they navigate cross-team tradeoffs without defaulting to team
ownership or passive compliance.
