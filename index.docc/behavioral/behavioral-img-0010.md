# Research-led Problem Reframing


Strong behavioral stories show you used evidence to change the problem definition, not just to
validate a solution you already wanted.

## What This Signal Proves

- You can diagnose the real source of user pain.
- You resist the easy fix and validate assumptions early.
- You collaborate with engineering to balance intent and feasibility.

## How to Tell This Story

1) Identify the assumption that was wrong.
2) Explain the research you ran and what surprised you.
3) Show how the insight changed the solution direction.
4) Call out the collaboration needed to ship the change.

## Example Narrative Moves

- "We assumed the flow was too long; research showed confusion was the real driver."
- "We redesigned with progressive disclosure and clearer reasoning for each request."
- "We iterated with engineering when the APIs couldn't support auto-fill."

## Outcome Focus

Quantify the shift in behavior and quality. Tie results to both user outcomes and operational
metrics (e.g., abandonment rates and support tickets).
