# Conflict Stories Across Cultural Contexts

Not every workplace rewards direct conflict. If your prior organization was hierarchical or
conflict-avoidant, add context so the interviewer can interpret your choices correctly.

## How to Frame it

- Acknowledge the cultural constraints explicitly.
- Describe the actions you took within that context.
- Explain what you would do in a more conflict-positive culture.

## Use the Halo Effect

If you could not be assertive in one story, mention smaller examples that show your willingness to
speak up when possible.
