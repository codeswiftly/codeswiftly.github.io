# Conflict Learnings: Business Framing and Solution-first


The strongest learning from conflict stories is the ability to translate technical risk into
business consequences and to propose a solution alongside the problem.

## Key Learnings to Emphasize

- Quantify technical risk in business terms.
- Offer a path forward, not just a critique.
- Recognize stakeholder pressure and acknowledge it explicitly.

## Lasting Impact

If the story leads to a new process (e.g., data quality reviews), call that out as a durable
outcome.
