# Learning Loops in Product Decisions

Great behavioral answers show how you learned and adapted after the results. This turns a story
from "what I did" into "how I think and improve."

## What to Learn in Your Story

- Assumptions about user behavior can be wrong.
- Evidence is more persuasive than opinion.
- Early engineering partnership prevents late-stage redesigns.

## How to Present Learnings

- Describe the incorrect assumption explicitly.
- Share the evidence that changed your mind.
- Show how the lesson influenced future work or team process.

## Why This Matters

Interviewers want repeatable judgment. A story that ends with a concrete learning shows that you
will improve decisions over time, not just execute tasks.
