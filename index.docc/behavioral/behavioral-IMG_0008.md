A table of contents is not just a list of phases. It is a framing device that tells the
interviewer what to conclude about you after each section.

## Make the Takeaway Explicit

Instead of listing phases alone, attach a conclusion to each theme.

Weak outline:

- Initiation
- Alignment
- Design
- Implementation
- Rollout

Signal-first outline:

- Initiation: I proved the opportunity with user data.
- Alignment: I earned leadership buy-in through a clear roadmap.
- Design: I negotiated constraints without compromising quality.
- Implementation: I solved a hard technical bottleneck.
- Rollout: I coordinated stakeholders and de-risked launch.

## Why This Works

The interviewer hears the headline before the details. That makes your story easier to follow and
positions you as intentional rather than reactive.

## Start the Story Quality Pass

After you draft a story, perform a quick signal check:

- Can a reviewer identify the key takeaways?
- Do those takeaways match what you want to be hired for?
