This example shows a strategic conflict between platform stability and feature velocity. The
signal is how you balance near-term competitiveness with long-term sustainability.

## How to Frame it

- Establish the business pressure to ship features.
- Quantify the operational cost of technical debt.
- Show that the conflict is about strategy, not ego.

## What the Interviewer Looks for

- Can you reason about tradeoffs with data?
- Can you work with engineering leadership under pressure?
- Can you propose a phased plan that reduces risk?
