# Results Include Relationships

In conflict stories, success is not only delivery. It is also whether the relationship survived and
remained productive.

## What to Include in Results

- The project moved forward or shipped.
- The relationship stabilized or improved.
- Evidence of continued collaboration.

## If the Relationship Did Not Recover

Explain the constraints that made it hard, and highlight what you did to repair trust. This shows
maturity even when outcomes were imperfect.
