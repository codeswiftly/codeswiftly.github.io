Behavioral stories land when you show that you avoided overbuilding, learned quickly, and changed
course with evidence.

## Prototype Before Commitment

- Build a lightweight proof of concept.
- Test on a small user segment.
- Use the results to validate behavior assumptions.

## Pivot on Evidence

When results are weak, show how you diagnosed the gap and adjusted the approach instead of forcing
an inferior solution.

## Cross-functional Coordination

AI and automation features require tight collaboration:

- Engineering for model or algorithm changes.
- Support or operations for labeled feedback.
- Legal or policy for risk and correctness constraints.

## Continuous Feedback Loops

Make sure the system learns from real usage. Route failures to humans, capture why the model
missed, and use that data to improve the next iteration.
