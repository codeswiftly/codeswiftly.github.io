# Inflection Point Storytelling


Some projects are best told through the inflection points that changed the trajectory. This style
is a thematic structure that emphasizes the moments where your judgment mattered most.

## What Counts As An Inflection Point

Pick 3 to 5 decision moments where the outcome could have swung the other way. Each inflection
point should surface a high-signal skill (ownership, influence, technical judgment, or risk
management).

Examples of inflection points:

- You reframed the problem after new research changed the direction.
- You aligned leadership and secured funding or resourcing.
- You resolved a complex constraint with a clear tradeoff.
- You unblocked a technical bottleneck during implementation.
- You changed the rollout plan to protect quality or reliability.

## How to Present Inflection Points

- Open with a one-line context and the decision pressure.
- State the action you took and why you chose it.
- Quantify the result and call out the learning.

This structure keeps the story tight while letting you highlight the most important signals early.
