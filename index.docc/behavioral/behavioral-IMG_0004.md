# CARL Story Scaffolding


Behavioral answers land best when you have a scaffold. You will not recite a story, but you will
sound crisp when you already know the transitions and the core beats. CARL (Context, Action,
Result, Learning) is the backbone for long, multi-layered stories.

## Build Core Stories Inside Out

Start with Actions and expand outward. This keeps your narrative anchored in decisions and
execution, not vague background.

1) Outline a table of contents for the Actions.
2) Draft mini-CARLs for each action theme.
3) Add the minimal Context required to raise stakes and clarify constraints.
4) Close with Results and Learnings so the outcome is measurable and memorable.

## Table of Contents for Long Stories

Senior stories are often long. A table of contents makes them digestible and prevents rambling.
It also gives the interviewer permission to jump in with follow-ups.

## Action Organization Options

There are two reliable ways to organize Actions:

- Chronological phases for complex, multi-stage projects.
- Thematic action clusters for stories where you need to highlight specific signals.

Use the table of contents to show how you will navigate the action section before you dive into
details.
