This is the day your prep becomes presence. Keep the pace calm, the signal high, and your tone
steady. You do not need to be perfect. You need to be clear, honest, and easy to follow.

## Center the Day

- Build a small ritual: `water`, `notebook`, `timer`, deep breath before the first call.
- Use a short reset between rounds: stand up, stretch, and write one quick note about what landed.
- Treat each round as a fresh start, not a continuation of the last one.

## Before the First Call

- Confirm time zones, meeting links, and device or IDE readiness; close noisy apps.
- Flip on `Do Not Disturb` and keep your desktop simple.
- Keep a one-page crib sheet: constraints, metrics, recent bugs fixed, and open questions.
- Have 2-3 thoughtful questions about roadmap, architecture, and success metrics.

## One Hour to Interview Timeline

Time | Focus | Action
---- | ----- | ------
T-60 | Settle | Fill water, quick stretch, and open the note you will reference.
T-45 | Prime | Review the role, the team focus, and the top 3 stories you want ready.
T-30 | Reset | Skim your crib sheet, confirm the environment, and close extra windows.
T-20 | Warm Up | Pick one coding prompt and restate the solution out loud.
T-10 | Center | Breathe, set posture, and decide your first clarifying question.
T-05 | Join | Enter the call, check audio, and open the scratchpad you will share.
T-00 | Begin | Greet, confirm the agenda, and start with a calm restatement of the prompt.

- `T-60` grab water! calm space, reference note open.
- `T-45` 3 stories chosen, role recap noted, timing plan in view.
- `T-30` crib sheet reviewed, IDE/theme set, font size readable, screen share window ready.

## During Each Round

- If you get stuck, name the unknown and propose a next step or a clarifying question.

## Close the Loop

- Finish with gratitude and next steps; restate enthusiasm and fit.
- Write down 2-3 lines right after the call while the details are fresh.
