MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Let's look at how you can choose the right story, de-
scribe it in the right way using CARL, hitting the right
notes throughout.
[281
Choose a story with high stakes, high involve-
ment, and where you were right
When picking a conflict story, pick ones where:
The stakes were high: scope of your conflicts is a reli-
able indicator of your level. Conflicts over formatting a
codebase or which features to include in a release are low
stakes versus conflicts over long-lived system design or
team charters.
You were deeply involved: being a central player in a
conflict is the only way for a listener to evaluate your
conflict resolution skills. Make sure you did something to
bring about a resolution.
You ended up being right: it is less risky to tell a story
where you were right, at least partially. Humility is valu-
able but not the signal the interviewer seeks and you risk
looking like someone who makes poor judgments.
Common conflict stories
Candidates often think they don't have a conflict story,
that the interviewer is asking for an emotional drama
or when a coworker was being overtly combative with
them. But that's not the case. Workplaces are filled with
the kinds of conflicts that make great stories:
