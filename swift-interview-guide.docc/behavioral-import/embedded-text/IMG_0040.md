MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
prospect represented 40% of our projected revenue for the
quarter.
ACTION
I understood the business pressure, but I also knew that
shipping a model with poor precision would be catastrophic
- false positives would block legitimate customer transac-
tions, potentially losing us existing users and damaging our
reputation with the enterprise prospect we were trying to
win.
First, I ran a quick analysis to quantify the impact. I
trained a baseline model on the existing data and found it
had a 23% false positive rate on our validation set. I calcu-
lated that this would block roughly $2M in legitimate trans-
actions monthly for our current customer base.
I scheduled a meeting with the product manager and pre-
sented this data, but she remained firm on the timeline.
She said the business risk of delaying was greater than the
technical risk of shipping an imperfect model. At this point,
I could see she was stressed and feeling caught between com-
peting pressures from leadership.
I then proposed a compromise: give me two weeks to clean
the most critical mislabeled examples while the engineer-
ing team built the model serving infrastructure. I offered to
work with our customer service team to review a sample of
transactions during business hours and create a more reli-
able training set. I also suggested we could launch with more
conservative thresholds initially to reduce false positives,
even if it meant catching fewer fraud cases at first.
