MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
STEP 5: PREPARE QUESTIONS
FOR THE INTERVIEWER
The five minutes at the end of your interview isn't just
courtesy time. It's your opportunity to demonstrate your
interest in the role, assess the fit for you, and communi-
cate what's important to you as a candidate.
Why Your Questions Matter
It may be a surprise to you, but interviewers evaluate you
based on what you choose to ask. No questions can indi-
cate disengagement or that you're treating this as trans-
actional. Thoughtful questions demonstrate:
• Preparation: You've researched the company and
role
• Strategic thinking: You understand what matters
for success
• Self-awareness: You know what you need to
thrive
• Genuine interest: You care about this specific
opportunity
• Maturity: You're thinking beyond just getting the
job
Your questions also serve a critical practical purpose:
gathering information to determine if this role, team,
and company align with your career goals and working
style.
