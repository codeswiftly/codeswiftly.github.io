MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In this project, I got to conduct user research with real
customers, collaborate closely with engineering on technical
constraints, and advocate for design decisions based on
data rather than assumptions.
ACTIONS
I proposed doing user testing to understand the real pain
points before redesigning anything. I recruited eight users
who had recently abandoned the flow and conducted mod-
erated usability sessions over video calls. What I discovered
surprised everyone—users weren't frustrated by the length,
but by the lack of clarity about why we needed certain infor-
mation and what would happen with their documents.
Based on these insights, I redesigned the flow with progres-
sive disclosure and clear explanations at each step. I also
had to work closely with our iOS developer to understand
what was technically feasible. My initial design assumed
we could auto-populate certain fields, but the APIs we were
using didn't support that. We iterated on a solution that
balanced user experience with technical constraints.
I also had to advocate for my research findings when the
product manager initially wanted to just remove screens to
make the flow shorter. I had to point them to the recorded
user sessions to demonstrate that explanation, not brevity,
was the real issue.
RESULTS
The new flow reduced abandonment from 60% to 45%.
