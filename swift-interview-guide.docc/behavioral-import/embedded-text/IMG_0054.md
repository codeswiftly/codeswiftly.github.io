MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Describe what you would have liked to do: if you were
in a more permissive culture, what would you have done.
It's even better if you tried to do these things but were
hampered.
Consider using the Halo Effect: if you have a string of
smaller stories to mention where you did demonstrate
assertiveness and willingness to rock the boat to make
things around you better.

V At my previous company in Tokyo, we had a very hier-
archical structure where directly challenging senior man-
agement decisions was considered disrespectful. When our
director announced we would launch our mobile app with-
out proper testing because a competitor had just released
theirs, I knew this could damage our reputation with enter-
prise clients.
In that culture, the expectation was to simply execute the
directive without question. However, I felt strongly that
we needed more time for quality assurance, so I worked
within the cultural constraints by approaching my imme-
diate manager privately and presenting data on potential
user impact. I also prepared a detailed risk assessment docu-
ment that outlined the technical concerns without directly
contradicting the director's timeline.
Ideally, I would have liked to bring this up directly in the
planning meeting with all stakeholders present, but I knew
that would have been seen as insubordination and could
have damaged working relationships across the team.
