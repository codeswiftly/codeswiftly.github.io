MASTERING BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS: THE GUI...
Through this project, I learned that Al features require
much more iteration than traditional features—the first
approach rarely works as expected. I also discovered the im-
portance of building feedback loops into Al products from
day one, since the quality depends on continuous learning.
Finally, I realized that cross-functional collaboration is es-
pecially critical for Al features because they touch so many
different areas of expertise.

CONTEXT
I was on the Data Platform team at a mid-sized marketing
analytics Saas company. Our customer data processing sys-
tem handled importing data from various sources, trans-
forming it, and making it available for analysis—about 2
million records per day for 5,000 enterprise customers.
I led the migration of our customer data processing sys-
tem from a monolithic Rails application to a microservices
architecture. The legacy Rails monolith was causing severe
business problems. Sales was losing enterprise deals worth
$4M per quarter because prospects couldn't import their
large datasets—the system would either fail or take days.
Customer Success was spending 30 hours weekly on data-re-
lated escalations, and we'd already lost two customers over
reliability issues. Just to top it off, Product couldn't ship the
Al-powered features that were our core competitive strategy
because the architecture couldn't support real-time data
processing.
