easier.
I learned that architectural decisions need to match cur-
rent organizational reality, not future aspirations. While
my technical reasoning about scalability was sound, I ig-

maturity. The "right" technical solution isn't always the
right business solution. Now I advocate for evolutionary
architecture---starting simple and splitting services only
when team size and complexity genuinely demand it. This
taught me to weight immediate team productivity more
heavily when making technology choices at early-stage com-
panies.
This seemed pretty clear in the beginning and even
though they call it out as a learning, this story comes
across as a net-negative on signal.
As a contrast, here's an example of where the outcome
