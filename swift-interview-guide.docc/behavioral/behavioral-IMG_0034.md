# Conflict Story Sources and Non-work Fallbacks

Work stories are best. Use non-work conflicts only if you genuinely lack professional examples.

1) Work experience
2) School projects
3) Personal situations

## Why This Matters

Work conflicts map most directly to the role and give the interviewer confidence that you can
handle disagreement in a professional context.
