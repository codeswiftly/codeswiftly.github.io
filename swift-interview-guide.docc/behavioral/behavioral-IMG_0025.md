# TMAY Anti-patterns to Avoid

Weak TMAY answers waste attention and reduce credibility. Avoid these common traps.

## Overly Personal Opening

Your personality matters, but open with role-relevant signals, not childhood stories or unrelated
hobbies.

## The History Lesson

Do not list every job in order. Instead, surface the 2 to 3 highlights that define your impact.

## Too Short to Be Useful

A single sentence without accomplishments forces the interviewer to guess your strengths. Include
2 to 3 achievements with measurable outcomes.
