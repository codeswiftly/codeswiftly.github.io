# Interviewer Style: Examiner

Some interviewers optimize for breadth. They interrupt, move quickly, and check many signals in a
short time.

## How to Succeed

- Stay calm when interrupted; it often means they got what they need.
- Lead with the headline, not the backstory.
- Compress context and move quickly to your actions and outcomes.

## Why it Works

They believe coverage across many scenarios is a better predictor than deep focus on one story.
