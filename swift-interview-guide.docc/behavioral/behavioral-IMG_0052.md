# Make the Conflict Explicit

If your story sounds like harmony, it is not a conflict story. The interviewer needs to hear the
real tension and how you navigated it.

## Signs of Missing Conflict

- Everyone agrees too quickly.
- There is no clear disagreement or pressure.
- The story ends without a hard decision.

## Fix it

- State what the other person wanted and why it conflicted with your position.
- Describe the emotional or organizational impact.
- Show how you moved from tension to resolution.
