# Question Strategy: Tailor, Specific, and Forward-looking

Good interviewer questions are tailored to what you care about and asked in a way that yields real
information.

## Tailor to Your Priorities

Decide in advance what matters most (growth, impact, balance, culture). Use that to choose 1 to 2
questions that actually influence your decision.

## Make Questions Specific

Avoid generic prompts like "What is the culture?" Ask for a concrete example instead.

## Favor Experience Over Hypotheticals

Ask about a real recent conflict or decision rather than how they "typically" do things.

## Include Forward-looking Questions

Ask about upcoming challenges and priorities, not just past work.
