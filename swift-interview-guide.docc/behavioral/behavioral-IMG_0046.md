## Key Takeaways

- Technical leaders often see risks product leaders do not.
- You must create space for technical concerns even under business pressure.
- You can preserve relationships by being transparent about tradeoffs.

## Process Improvements

Establish regular technical health reviews so infrastructure needs are visible and can be planned
rather than fought over.
