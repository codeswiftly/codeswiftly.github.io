# Use AI to Practice, But Not to Replace People

AI can expand your practice surface area, but it cannot fully simulate real interview pressure.

## High-value AI Use Cases

- Generate new behavioral questions from company values.
- Create follow-up question lists for your stories.
- Drill weak areas with rapid repetition.

## Know the Limitations

AI cannot replicate nonverbal feedback, conversational flow, or the emotional pressure of a live
interview. Use human mock interviews to validate delivery and presence.
