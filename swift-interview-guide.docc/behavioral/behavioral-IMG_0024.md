# Handling Gaps, Layoffs, and Short Stints in TMAY

If you have gaps or short stints, name them briefly and proactively. Set the narrative before the
interviewer fills it in.

## Best Practice

- Be concise and factual.
- Emphasize what you learned or how you grew during the gap.
- Keep the tone forward-looking.

## Examples of Framing

- Gap: used time to upskill in a new technical area.
- Layoff: acknowledged business change without blame.
- Short stints: focused on growth and accelerated learning.
